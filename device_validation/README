#
# Purpose: Reference model for validating the
#      Secure Identity and Proof of Possession
#      of the private key for a given device.
#      This script supports two methods to execute
#      the validations: PNP API and CLI.
#
# Requirements:
#   PNP API:
#      For PNP API method to work properly
#      the device must have the PNP listener enabled.
#   Assumption: The PNP API crednetials match the
#      SSH login credntials.
#
#   CLI:
#      For the CLI method to work properly the
#      device must support the 'show platform sudi...'
#      command (currently only in S-train).
#
# Input (devices.csv):
#   A comma seperated file (csv) is used for input to
#   determine which devices are to be examined. Each
#   record in the file must contain at least 4 or 5 fields:
#      For PNP:
#       - ip address of device
#       - method ("PNP" or "CLI")
#       - admin user id
#       - admin password
#       - UDI (optional)
#       - SUDI serial (optional)
#
#      For CLI:
#       - ip address of device
#       - method ("PNP" or "CLI")
#       - admin user id
#       - admin password
#       - enable password
#       - SUDI serial (optional)
#
#   For the optional fields, if they are missing, the
#   script will retrieve those data items from the device.
#   The retrieved values will be written out to the output file.
#
# Output (devices.csv, devices.old.csv <-- original input file):
#   An output file is created and overwrites the existing input file.
#   The new output file will contain any data that was collected from the
#   device which was missing prior (UDI, SUDI Serial).
#   The original input file will be renamed as .old.csv to keep for reference.
#
# Usage:
#   To validate all the devices listed in the input file:
#      ./device_validation.py
#
#   To validate a single device in the input file:
#      ./device_validation.py <ip address>
#
# Dependencies:
#   The python dependencies are as follows:
#        os, csv, requests, base64, string, random, struct
#        argparse, pexpect, binascii, xml.etree, OpenSSL, six
#   If any of these packages are missing, use your python package
#   installer to install them on your system.
#   This script was tested against python 2.7. Any other version is
#   untested and may not work as expected.
#
# Disclaimer:
#   This script is a demo tool and is unsupported. No guarantees or warranties
#   are implied. A modest effort was made to error check the various steps
#   but there are no guarantees that all error scenarios have been covered.
#
# Change Log:
#   V1.1 - added Product ID(PID) checking
